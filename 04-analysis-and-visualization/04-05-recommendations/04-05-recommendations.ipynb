This type of recommendation system makes predictions of what might interest a person based on the taste of many other users. It assumes that if person X likes Snickers, and person Y likes Snickers and Milky Way, then person X might like Milky Way as well. This version of collaborative filtering is close to clustering &mdash; the recommendations are points in hyperspace that are close to the initial points.\n",
