    "\n",
    "We encountered during the mid-term on 10/21 are attributable to _one or more_ of the following issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The network connection in Sci Tech 134 was flaky,\n",
    "2. The JupyterHub server was overwhelmed by the number of students trying to use it simultaneously,\n",
    "3. Zoom software that we were using for staying connected taxed everyone's individual machines.\n",
    "4. Problems with ok.py setup which were corrected later in the hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are reasons to suspect any of the above as possible causes though we don't know precisely which ones. \n",
    "Meanwhile, it would be difficult (if at all possible) to reconstruct everyone's work from what was turned in and grade it fairly. I'd like to follow a multi-part way out of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the midterm as a **take-home exam**. I hope most of you have partial copies of what you submitted. Feel free to fill in and/or correct what you submitted and resubmit as a PDF.\n",
    "2. Switch away from using the central JupyterHub server, instead encouraging the use of locally-installed Jupyter notebooks on your laptops in accordance with 01-01-getting-started and submitting PDFs into Canvas.\n",
    "3. Switch to a different method of submitting your solution for the remainder of the semester: PDF files submitted into Canvas rather than through ok.py. **The last two cells of the midterm notebook have been changed accordingly.** \n",
    "4. We will use Zoom sparingly in the future, using it during lectures as we have been doing in the last few weeks but relying on _Canvas Discussions_ to keep a communication channel open during exams.\n"
