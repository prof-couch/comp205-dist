    "Please enter your answers into this workbook in the places provided. You are allowed to create extra cells in the workbook to check out your reasoning and otherwise make notes. Just make sure that your \"final answer\" for each question is in the place marked for that purpose. \n",

    "This is an open-Internet examination. You may use any books and materials, and the entire Internet -- as well as all of the class workbooks and examples -- in answering these questions. You may not use direct communication with other *people* in completing this workbook. \n",

    "The final will be available on Canvas on Thursday 12/12 at 8:00 am and due on Saturday 12/14 by noon. The exam will be about 2 hours. The questions will cover Unit 3 onward. Multiple submissions will be permitted though _only the latest_ one will count.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will monitor&dagger; the Canvas Discussion (and the state of the JH server) during the day on Thursday (8:00 am to 4:00 pm), Friday afternoon (noon to 4:00 pm) and Saturday morning (8:00 am to noon).\n",
