    "According to the [documentation](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/topic/automatic-merging.html#topic-automatic-merging), it shouldn't be necessary for the instructor to create new versions of notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the student has deleted a file locally, but the file is still present in the remote repo, the file from the remote repo is pulled into the student’s directory. This enables the use case where a student wants to ‘start over’ a file after having made many changes to it. They can simply delete the file, click the nbgitpuller link again, and get a fresh copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just need to delete your local version in order to get the latest. Let us try it with the `03-04-dataframes-in-pandas` notebook. Load the notebook by clicking on the Canvas link. It may bring an old copy of the notebook (if you had worked on it before) or a fresh copy (if you hadn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make an innocuous change to the notebook (put your name into a **`code`** cell, for example) and Save and Checkpoint it. \n",
    "2. To avoid losing your work, use **File >> Make a Copy...** to create a backup. \n",
    "3. Delete the notebook by going up a directory level. In other words, if your URL is `.../a/b/c.ipynb`, go to `.../a/b/` in a different tab, select the `.../a/b/c.ipynb` file and delete it.\n",
    "4. Click on the Canvas link again. _The changes you had made in step 1 should have disappeared, proving that deleting the file and coming back in through Canvas loads a fresh copy of the notebook!_\n",

    "\n",
    "* Numpy is limited by the basic limit of having to have the same type for every element of an `ndarray`. That is its strength and its weakness. <img align=\"right\" style=\"padding-left:10px; height: 65%; width: 65%\" src=\"Addenda/figures/numpy-arrays.png\" >\n",
    "    * Numpy's ability to deal with multidimensional data is a major advantage when doing scientific calculations using vectors, matrices and tensors.\n",
    "    * The exercise in 03-03-data-ingest revealed this limitation of Numpy when we couldn't read a rectangular structure with dissimilar data types into an `ndarray`. See SciPy [Structured Arrays and Structured Datatypes](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html) for more details.\n",
    "    * Metadata information &mdash; what each row or column represents must be maintained outside of the `ndarray`\n",
    "* Columns in a typical spreadsheet can each be of a different type. \n",
    "* Thus, Numpy does not correctly express spreadsheets. \n",
    "* The `DataFrame` concept completely embodies the concept of a spreadsheet with multiple column types. \n",
    "\n",
    "These workbooks are based upon [pandas in 10 minutes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) and subsequent detailed tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pandas and numpy\n",
    "* Pandas is -- in fact -- based upon `numpy` and `numpy.ndarray` concepts. \n",
    "* The convenience of Pandas comes from being higher-level. \n",
    "* In a detailed analysis, `numpy.ndarray` is often still required, e.g., for TensorFlow and related tools. \n",
