Google the phrase or visit [MoralFoundations.org](https://moralfoundations.org/) to learn more about the theory (or watch [Jonathan Haidt's Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_the_moral_roots_of_liberals_and_conservatives/)).\n",

    "In the coding, the above two moral opposites are called 'HarmVirtue' and 'HarmVice' respectively. Similarly for other moral dimensions. The categories and the words that belong to each are available on-line in a [Moral Foundations Dictionary](https://moralfoundations.org/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/moral%20foundations%20dictionary.dic). The dictionary words often include &ast;s, for example `peace`&ast;, which could be peace, peaceful, peacefully, even peacenik!\n",

    "### Code Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious design is to create a dictionary that maps each word &rArr; category. Then we could take each word in an incoming tweet and categorize it. _But the &ast;s throw a wrench into this idea!_ How would it categorize \"He came peacefully\" when a dictionary whose key was peace&ast; wouldn't match the word \"peacefully!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And if a dictionary won't solve the problem, won't looking up each tweet word without the benefit of a dictionary be too slow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our design will be based on a combination of strategies: using a dictionary with 3-letter keys, and having each key map to a (relatively short) list that could be scanned quickly. For example, one of the longest lists will be \"dis\": [discriminat&ast;, disproportion&ast;, dishonest, dissociate, disloyal&ast;, dissent&ast;, disrespect&ast;, disobe&ast;, dissident, disgust&ast;, disease&ast;]. A particular Python class for this is a `defaultdict`, shown [here by example](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#defaultdict-examples)."
